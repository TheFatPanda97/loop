### Motivation

With the introduction of ChatGPT, one interesting feature it provides is that it can generate code! However, given a prompt for the desired code, the response is often kinda wonky. So, rather than giving it a prompt, why not give it a test? This is the idea behind loop, a simple VS Code extension that supports test-driven development by generating code that passes given tests.
